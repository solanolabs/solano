Solano CI is a hosted continuous deployment platform that runs your build
and test suites in the cloud, in parallel.  Your tests run isolated in
freshly prepared workers that are automatically configured with real
database and search engine instances to match your development and
production environments.

Solano CI also supports parallel test running in our cloud even before
you push to a shared branch.

The `solano` gem implements a command line interface for you to start
a parallel run from your local git workspace, along with ways to edit
configuration and retrieve your account status all from within your
terminal.
